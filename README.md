Formerly Russia Today Vote Botting

I decided to create my own bots written in C# because there are downvoter bots going on, kept mass downvoting pro-ukrainian comments, even some pro-russian (pro-ukrainian who pretended to be pro-russian maybe?). According to some users and some research, it was Z__Z__Z who was all behind of it, [I have the PROOF (Change your DNS to Cloudflare if you can't aceess imgur)](https://imgur.com/a/klDCUbm). I wrote this tool in rush, so the code might be messy, and also I have less experience in C#, my friend usually help me with this, but not anymore.

Always be prepared with vote fighting. 

**PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU WANT THE TOOL.**

**Are you a programmer? do let me know :D**
